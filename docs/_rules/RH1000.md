description: Nullable type assigned to default of underlying type
category: Usage

## Cause

A nullable type is assigned to default value of the underlying type.

Note: does not target `DateTime?` or `DateTimeOffset?`, since a separate rule covering them exists.

## Reason for rule

Helps locating sites where `default` might erronously be used against a nullable value type. Any such sites require review in context of the domain.

## How to fix violations

If applicable, assign type to default(T?) or null.

## Examples

### Violates

```csharp
bool? value = default(bool);
```

### Does not violate

```csharp
bool? value = default(bool?);
```
