title: RH1001
description: Nullable DateTime or DateTimeOffset assigned to default of underlying type
category: Usage
severity: Warning
---

## Cause

A nullable DateTime or DateOffset is assigned to default value of the underlying type.

## Reason for rule

Helps locating sites where `default` might erronously be used against a nullable `DateTime` or `DateTimeOffset`.

This rule is separate from `RH1000` since domains where the default, `1.1.0001 0.00.00`, is a meaningful value in terms of the domain context are few.

## How to fix violations

If applicable, assign type to default(T?) or null.

## Examples

### Violates

```csharp
DateTime? value = default(DateTime);
```

### Does not violate

```csharp
DateTime? value = default(DateTime?);
```
